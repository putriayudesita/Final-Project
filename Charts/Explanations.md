## CHARTS EXPLANANTIONS

MEWMV (Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Variance) is used to monitoring the variability of a process. This control chart has two control limits which called _Upper Control Limit_ and _Lower Control Limit_ which if any ```trace(Vn)`` value is exceeding this limit, it would called an **Out of Control** observations.
Meanwhile, SSRM (Spatial Signed Rank MEWMA) is used to monitoring the mean of a process. This control chart only has _Upper Control Chart_ as the lower one is always has **zero** as its value.

If there is at least one OOC in a chart, it can be said that the process is not in control.
